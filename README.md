# PSU_2016_my_printf

EPITECH

You must recode the printf function from the C library. You function should be prototyped like the printf function.
You do no have to perform the C library printf buffer handling.
You must process all printf formatting flags except the following (which are optional):
- float or double types management,
- %n flag management.

You must add %b handling, which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base.
You must also add %S handling, which prints a character string (like %s). However, non-printable characters (ASCII
value stricly smaller than 32 or greater or equal than 127) must be represented by a backslash to be followed by the
characterâ€™s value in octal base.
